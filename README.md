# kgutils

Every project tends to have a `utils` file, with convenience functions developed along the way.
This repository is a collection of my `utils`, including:

* configuration files for various software packages, such as Emacs, Zsh, Python, etc.
* Python installation scripts.
* random snippets of Python / R code that I end up having to reinvent repeatedly.
